## Virtually Induced Motor Adaption Study

This research project aims to investigate a multitude of things: How effectively can motor adaptions be induced using consumer grade virtual reality technologies? What factors assist/retard the rate at which the adaptations occur while inducting them via virtual reality?  

All scripts have been developed for the [Unity Engine](https://unity3d.com/) and [HTC Vive](https://www.vive.com/eu/) with optional [trackers](https://www.vive.com/us/vive-tracker/).
